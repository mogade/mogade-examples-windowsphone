# Not Complete #

Work on this example has just begun. It is not complete.


# What's Working #

 * Setting up the mogade library
 * Submitting a score
 * Logging application starts
 * Logging error


# Where to Start #
You'll want to head over to `code/MogadeProvider.cs` and take a look around. You can find the other mogade integration points by simply searching for `MogadeProvider` throughout the project.

# In your Own Project #
The assemblies that this example uses (in the root `References` folder) might not be the most up to date. You should grab the latest from the [GitHub](https://github.com/mogade/mogade-windowsphone) page.

You'll also want to change the `MogadeProvider` to use your `gamekey` and `secret`. Finally, you'll want to change the leaderboard id used in `GameOver.xaml.cs` with your leaderboard id.

# One Last Thing #

The secret and key distributed with this example is a **real** game residing on testing.mogade.com. This is a test environment and it isn't necessarily reliable.
